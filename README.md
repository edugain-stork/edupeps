eduPEPS
=======
This piece os software is the implementation of the solution proposed to integrate eduGAIN and STORK. The name eduPEPS comes from the union of eduGAIN and PEPS (Pan European Proxy Service), the backbone STORK element.

The role of this software is acting as a proxy where the translation between SAMLint <--> SAMLstork and the attribute mapping is done. This software is a proof of concept and is provided as it is.

This work is being done as part of the GÃ©ant GN4 project in collaboration with eid Stork2.
